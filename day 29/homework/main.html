            <li>Blu Atlas Atlantis</li>
            <img src="/day 29/homework/images/atlantis.png">
            <p><i>A wearable version of a Bali jungle, Atlantis is ripe with adventure and passion—the perfect qualities to take with you into 2023. More specifically, the signature fragrance from personal care brand Blu Atlas is inspired by the sights, scents, and sensations of Bali’s coastal jungles. It opens with ripe bergamot, lemon, and blackcurrant fruits before mingling with uplifting notes of lavender, clary sage, peach, and apricot.</i> </p>

            <li>Yves Saint Laurent, Y Le Parfum</li>
            <img src="/day 29/homework/images/saintlaurent.png">
            <p><i>An aromatic heart of sage, lavender, and geranium are clean and pleasant, blending perfectly into the sophisticated base of tonka bean, cedar, patchouli, and olibanum (a green balsamic note with hints of woods and spice). This makes for a great nighttime fragrance. Pop it on before heading to dinner or the club.</i></p>

            <li>Tom Ford, Oud Wood</li>
            <img src="/day 29/homework/images/tomford.png">
            <p><i>Dark, woody, creamy, and effortlessly sexy, Oud Wood is one of the best moody masculine scents to have in your collection. Yes, it’s great for date night, but you can also wear it to the office on chilly fall and winter days.</i></p>

            <li>Dior, Sauvage Elixir</li>
            <img src="/day 29/homework/images/sauvage.png">
            <p><i>You’ve got freshness, addictive spices, rich woods, French lavender, and a sexy licorice note to play up the scent’s sweetness. Opening notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, and grapefruit solidify this as a warm, spicy concoction, but it’s the base of licorice, sandalwood, amber, patchouli, and vetiver that is smooth and intoxicating. This beast of a fragrance scores ten out of ten on projection, longevity, sillage, and scent.</i></p>

            <li>Giorgio Armani, Acqua di Giò Profondo Eau de Parfum</li>
            <img src="/day 29/homework/images/aquadigio.png">
            <p><i>When it comes to men’s fragrances, Acqua di Giò and all its flankers can do wrong. In this version, we’re taking a deep dive into the sea with the brand’s signature marine accord alongside green mandarin and bergamot top notes. A heart of rosemary, cypress, lavender, and mastic adds freshness before drying down to a masculine base of musk, patchouli, and a mineral amber accord reminiscent of the salty sea. Oceanic, clean, and universally flattering, </i></p>
